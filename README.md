- 👋 Hi, I’m @cmobrien123

- 👀 I’m interested in how data can be used to help experts in various fields find unexpected relationships and patterns. In particular, I am interested in how healthcare interoperability can be improved to empower healthcare experts and policy makers with the data they need to save lives and build new healthcare solutions. However, I am also excited to learn more about how data science is being applied in other industries. I am also interested in other emerging technologies such as blockchain and how they can be used to make sustainable solutions for real world problems. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning programing in python and R, as well as exploratory data analysis and visualization. I am enrolled in UVA's Masters of Science in Data Science, which includes studying a variety of topics including data mining, linear models for data science, statistical learning, Bayesian machine learning, deep learning, and ethics of big data. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects to further my understanding of how to apply data science and machine learning to solve real world problems. In particular, I am excited to apply what I am learning in my courses to challenges facing private and public section partners of UVA in a capstone project I will start in the fall of 2021.
