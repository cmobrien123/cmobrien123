-Hi, I’m Colin O'Brien

- I’m interested in how data can be used to help experts in various fields find unexpected relationships and patterns. In particular, I am interested in how healthcare interoperability can be improved to empower healthcare experts and policy makers with the data they need to save lives and build new healthcare solutions. However, I am also excited to learn more about how data science is being applied in other industries. I am also interested in other emerging technologies such as blockchain and how they can be used to make sustainable solutions for real world problems. 

- I am enrolled in UVA's Masters of Science in Data Science, which includes studying a variety of topics including data mining, linear models for data science, statistical learning, Bayesian machine learning, deep learning, and ethics of big data.
